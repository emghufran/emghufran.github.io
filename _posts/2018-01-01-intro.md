I am a Senior Data Scientist, AI Research Lead with extensive experience in Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic Workflows, MLOps and architecting advanced Data and AI systems. I specialize in Industrial AI, applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in maintenance, semantic search, and data architecture.

I hold a PhD from University Paris-Sud, where my research focused on Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, and Social Network Analysis. I have worked with the LRI Laboratory Heterogenous Modeling (ModHel) team and taught at Paris-Sud University and CentraleSupélec.

Previously, I worked at Xerox Research Centre Europe (now NaverLabs Europe) on prediction, forecasting, optimisation and time series analysis of large datasets.

I am passionate about discovering new methods to solve challenging problems, particularly in Generative AI, Deep Learning, distributed computing, and the application of AI on large-scale industrial data. I am interested in applying existing techniques and methods as well as discovering new methods to solve challenging problems.
