I am a PhD graduate from University Paris-Sud. I am currently working at the LRI Laboratory Heterogenous Modeling (ModHel) team, in collaboration with Dr. Nacera Bennacer and Dr. Gianluca Quercini. I am also teaching at Paris-Sud University as an A.T.E.R. 

My work is in primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing. A large part of my recent work has been focused on Information Extraction from non-structured documents. In addition, I have worked with social network graphs. Particularly, I have worked on detection of profiles belonging to the same person across social networks, also known as profile reconciliation. I have also worked on disambiguation and inference of location information present in social network profiles. 

Previously, I have worked with prediction and forecasting as well as time series analysis of large data sets as part of my work at Xerox Research Centre Europe (now NaverLabs Europe). 

I am interested in applying existing techniques and methods as well as discovering new methods to solve challenging problems. I have become particularly interested Deep Learning, distributed computing and application of machine learning methods on large data sets.
